        <pre style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">        Drug discovery is the process through which potential new therapeutic entities are identified, using a combination of computational, 
        experimental, translational, and clinical models.Despite advances in biotechnology and understanding of biological systems, drug discovery is still a lengthy, 
        costly, difficult, and inefficient process with a high attrition rate of new therapeutic discovery. Drug design is the inventive process of finding 
        new medications based on the knowledge of a biological target. In the most basic sense, drug design involves the design of molecules that are complementary 
        in shape and charge to the molecular target with which they interact and bind. Drug design frequently but not necessarily relies on computer modeling techniques
        and bioinformatics approaches in the big data era. In addition to small molecules, biopharmaceuticals and especially therapeutic antibodies are an increasingly 
        important class of drugs and computational methods for improving the affinity, selectivity, and stability of these protein-based therapeutics have also gained 
        great advances.

    <pre style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;">        The creative process of developing novel drugs based on an understanding of a biological target is known as drug design.
        Designing molecules that are complementary in shape and charge to the molecular target with which they interact and bind is the most fundamental aspect of
        medication development. All areas of drug discovery are covered in the course, including genomics, bioinformatics, structural biology, 
        cheminformatics, molecular modelling, fragment-based drug design, drug target choice, intellectual property, and commercialization. These are the two main 
        categories of medication design. Both are known as structure-based drug design and ligand-based drug design, respectively. 
        great advances.
